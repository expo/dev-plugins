# Expo DevTools Plugins

- A collection of Expo DevTools Plugins.
- The repository here is a Proof-Of-Concept for Expo DevTools Plugins and showing the migration effort for moving Flipper Plugins to Expo DevTools Plugins.

## Awesome Plugins

- `@dev-plugins/apollo-client`: Plugin for [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/)

  - Credit: Most code are forked from [react-query-apollo-devtools](https://github.com/razorpay/react-native-apollo-devtools)

- `@dev-plugins/react-query`: Plugin for [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/)

  - Credit: Most code are forked from [react-query-native-devtools](https://github.com/bgaleotti/react-query-native-devtools)

- `@dev-plugins/react-navigation`: Plugin for [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/)

  - Credit: Most code are forked from [@react-navigation/devtools](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/tree/4797ace/packages/devtools) and the [Flipper plugin frontend](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/tree/4797ace/packages/flipper-plugin-react-navigation)

## Example App

The [example app](/apps/example) is an [Expo Router](https://docs.expo.dev/routing/introduction/) app that provides test cases for plugins

- Expo Router is based on React Navigation, so you can just test `@dev-plugins/react-navigation` from visiting different screens from the app.
